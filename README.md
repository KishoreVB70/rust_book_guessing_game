### Context
- My first Rust program.
- A simple guessing game made following the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) official documentation

### Functionality
- A looping game where user is needed to guess a number in input range
- The program will generate a random number, if the guess doesn't match, the program would instruct the user if the guess is higher or smaller
- The loop will continue till the user guesses the correct number
- Added the additional functionality of obtaining the guess upper limit from the user
